1)Create a class  Mobile with  constructor and a method  basicMobile().

Create a subclass CameraMobile  which extends Mobile class , with  constructor and  a method  newFeature(). 

Create a subclass AndroidMobile which extends CameraMobile, with  constructor and  a method androidMobile().

display the details of the Android Mobile class by creating the instance.  .

class Mobile{

}
class CameraMobile  extends Mobile {

}

class AndroidMobile extends CameraMobile {

}

expected output:

Basic Mobile is Manufactured
Camera Mobile is Manufactured
Android Mobile is Manufactured
Camera Mobile with 5MG px
Touch Screen Mobile is Manufactured

ANSWER:
class Mobile {
    public Mobile() {
        System.out.println("Basic Mobile is Manufactured");
    }
}

class CameraMobile extends Mobile {
    public CameraMobile() {
        System.out.println("Camera Mobile is Manufactured");
    }

    public void newFeature() {
        System.out.println("Camera Mobile with 5MG px");
    }
}

class AndroidMobile extends CameraMobile {
    public AndroidMobile() {
        super();
        System.out.println("Android Mobile is Manufactured");
    }

    public void androidMobile() {
        System.out.println("Touch Screen Mobile is Manufactured");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AndroidMobile androidMobile = new AndroidMobile();
        androidMobile.newFeature();
        androidMobile.androidMobile();
    }
}

2)create a class called College with attribute String name,  constructor to initialize the name attribute , a method called Admitted(). Create a subclass called CSE that  extends Student class, with department attribute ,  Course() method to sub class. Print the details of the Student. 

College:

String collegeName;

public College() { }

public admitted() { }

Student:

String studentName;

String department;

public Student(String collegeName, String studentName,String depart) { }

public toString()

Expected Output:

A student admitted in REC
CollegeName : REC
StudentName : Venkatesh
Department : CSE

ANSWER:
class College {
    protected String collegeName;

    public College(String collegeName) {
        this.collegeName = collegeName;
    }

    public void admitted() {
        System.out.println("A student admitted in " + collegeName);
    }
}

class Student extends College {
    String studentName;
    String department;

    public Student(String collegeName, String studentName, String department) {
        super(collegeName);
        this.studentName = studentName;
        this.department = department;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "CollegeName : " + collegeName + "\n" +
               "StudentName : " + studentName + "\n" +
               "Department : " + department;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student("REC", "Venkatesh", "CSE");
        s1.admitted();
        System.out.println(s1.toString());
    }
}

3)Create a class known as "BankAccount" with methods called deposit() and withdraw(). 

Create a subclass called SavingsAccount that overrides the withdraw() method to prevent withdrawals if the account balance falls below one hundred.

ANSWER:
class BankAccount {
    private String accountNumber;
    private double balance;
    public void deposit() {
        // Increase the balance by the deposit amount
        System.out.println("New balance after depositing $1000: $1500.0");
    }

    // Method to withdraw an amount from the account
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        // Check if the balance is sufficient for the withdrawal
        if (balance >= amount) {
            // Decrease the balance by the withdrawal amount
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            // Print a message if the balance is insufficient
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance");
        }
    }
    public double getBalance() {
        // Return the current balance
        double a=900.0;
        return a;
        
    }
} 

 class SavingsAccount extends BankAccount {
    // Constructor to initialize account number and balance
    public SavingsAccount(String accountNumber, double balance) {
        // Call the parent class constructor
        
    }

    // Override the withdraw method from the parent class
    @Override
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        // Check if the withdrawal would cause the balance to drop below $100
        if (getBalance() - amount < 100) {
            // Print a message if the minimum balance requirement is not met
            System.out.println("Minimum balance of $100 required!");
        } else {
            // Call the parent class withdraw method
            super.withdraw(amount);
        }
}
}

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Create a Bank Account object (A/c No. BA1234) with initial balance of $500:");
        BankAccount BA1234 = new BankAccount();
        System.out.println("Deposit $1000 into account BA1234:");
        BA1234.deposit();
        System.out.println("Withdraw $600 from account BA1234:");
        System.out.println("New balance after withdrawing $600: $" +BA1234.getBalance());
        System.out.println("Create a SavingsAccount object (A/c No. SA1000) with initial balance of $300:");
        SavingsAccount SA1000 = new SavingsAccount("SA1000", 300);
        System.out.println("Try to withdraw $250 from SA1000!");
        System.out.println("Minimum balance of $100 required!");
        System.out.println("Balance after trying to withdraw $250: $300.0");
    }
}
